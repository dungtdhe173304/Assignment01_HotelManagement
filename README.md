Hotel Management System (HMS) can help you streamline and automate various aspects of 
managing a hotel. It can help you keep track of room reservations, bills, guest information, and
financial transactions. The HMS can also help you manage housekeeping and maintenance tasks,
as well as track inventory and purchase orders. Building an HMS can also help you improve
customer satisfaction by providing them with a user-friendly interface to book rooms and
manage their stays. Here are some key components and functions of a Hotel Management
System
- Online Booking and Reservation: The system allows customers to make bookings and
reservations online through a user-friendly interface. It provides real-time availability of
vehicles, rental rates, and booking confirmations.
- Room Management: Room management in a hotel management system refers to the
process of efficiently and effectively managing the rooms and their occupants in a hotel.Â 
- Customer Management: The system maintains a database of customer information,
including contact details, identification documents, and room booking history. It enables
easy retrieval of customer records, communication, and personalized service.
